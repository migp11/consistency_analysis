Consistency Analysis is a Python 3 package to perform gap analysis of genome-scale metabolic models.
The the package was developed on the top of cobrapy (https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/) and implement
the unconnected modules approach proposed in [1]. It includes a single module (unconnected_modules.py) 
were the class UmFinder is implemented. The class allows to identify blocked reactions, gap metabolites 
and the set of unconnected modules as defined in [1].
