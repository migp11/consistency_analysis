What is consistency_analysis?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consistency Analysis is a Python 3 package tha implemnts
constraint-based modeling methods to perform gap analysis 
in genome-scale metabolic models of any organism.

The the package was developed on the top of cobrapy: 

- https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/

and implement the unconnected modules approach proposed in [1]. 
The package includes a single module (unconnected_modules.py) 
were the class UmFinder is implemented. 

The UmFinder allows to identify:
- blocked reactions
- gap metabolites 
- the set of unconnected modules 

as defined in [1].
